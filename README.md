# MTG-Card-Guessing-Game
 1/2/2021
 This Game gives the player six cards(facing down) to choose from. Each card is part of a pair, and if they guess correctly, they get a point. The front facing sides of the cards are pulled randomly from the MTG API (https://magicthegathering.io/). The player can guess as many times as they would like. In other words, there is no losing condition, only a win condition. I've enjoyed working on this as I am a long-time Magic: The Gathering fan. It was also good practice. Will make more finishing touches tomorrow.

 Added a timeout to allow the player to see the cards chosen for a few seconds before reseting the card images, if their guess was incorrect. I also added a fallback image for each card image class if two of the image urls are identical or if there is no image url for one of the three particular cards that are randomly pulled.

 I added a couple of the best planeswalkers of MTG to the background, Sorin and Elspeth! Also, just generally made the UI look a bit more pleasant.
