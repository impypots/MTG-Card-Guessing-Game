# MTG-Card-Guessing-Game
 1/2/2020
 This Game gives the player six cards(facing down) to choose from. Each card is part of a pair, and if they guess correctly, they get a point. The front facing sides of the cards are pulled randomly from the MTG API (https://magicthegathering.io/). The player can guess as many times as they would like. In other words, there is no losing condition, only a win condition. I've enjoyed working on this as I am a long-time Magic: The Gathering fan. It was also good practice. Will make more finishing touches tomorrow.
